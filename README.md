# Numerical Analysis Studies 📊

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to studying Numerical Analysis! Here, I document my learning journey based on the 9th edition of "Numerical Analysis" by Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires. Each chapter covers various aspects of numerical methods, accompanied by C implementations of algorithms.

## Contents 📚

1. [Chapter 1](chapter1/): Mathematical Preliminaries and Error Analysis
2. [Chapter 2](chapter2/): Solutions of Equations in One Variable
3. [Chapter 3](chapter3/): Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation
4. [Chapter 4](chapter4/): Numerical Differentiation and Integration
5. [Chapter 5](chapter5/): Initial Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations
6. [Chapter 6](chapter6/): Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems
7. [Chapter 7](chapter7/): Iterative Techniques in Matrix Algebra
8. [Chapter 8](chapter8/): Approximation Theory
9. [Chapter 9](chapter9/): Approximating Eigenvalues
10. [Chapter 10](chapter10/): Numerical Solutions of Nonlinear Systems of Equations
