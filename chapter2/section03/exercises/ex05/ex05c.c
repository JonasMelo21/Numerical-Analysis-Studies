    This code is part of my studies in numerical analysis,
    following Section 3 of Chapter 2 in the book "Numerical Analysis"
    by Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires, 11th edition.

    Approach: Let's use Newton's method to find root of  the equation f(x) = x - cos(x) = 0  within [0,Ï€/2] with 4 digits of accuracy.
