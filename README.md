# Numerical Analysis Studies
  - This Repository aims to keep track of my personal studies in the field of Numerical Analysis.
  - The book used as reference is the 9th edition of "Numerical Analysis" by Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires.
  - The chapters are listed bellow.
  - Each chapter contains a brief description of what's covered by the book 
  - Also each chapter contains a folder for each algorithm.
  - The algorithms are written in C Language.
