 * Description:
 * This file is part of my numerical analysis studies, based on
 * Section 3 of Chapter 2 from the book "Numerical Analysis"
 * by Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires, 11th edition.
 *
 * Objective:
 * Let's find out how many iteractions we need,with Newton Method, to find
 * a root for f(x) = cos(x) - x, with p0 = Ï€/4 and accuracy = 10^(-100)
