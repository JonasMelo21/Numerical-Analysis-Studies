# Quadratic Harmonic Series
This directory aims to solve the exercise 1 from section 3 of chapter 01:
Given a Series: 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16+...+ 1/81 + 1/100 = 1/(i^2) for 1 <= i <= 10
Compute the value of the series for i from 1 to 10 in direct order and in backwards
Which is more accurate ?
Hint.: The actual value for the series is 1.549
